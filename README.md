Hello, I am Cynthia, a web developer and a linguist. I obtained my degree in linguistics from California State University Northridge. I also obtained my certification in web development from Cal Poly Extended Education. My expertise in linguistics trained me to conduct and collect data, and analyze verbal and non-verbal communications in our society. In web development I was trained to create front-end and back-end projects using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, React.js and Node.js. I aspire to combine my knowledge to create immersive apps for consumers to enjoy.
